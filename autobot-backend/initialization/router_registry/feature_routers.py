Feature Router Loader

This module handles loading of feature-specific API routers.
These routers provide various application features like workflow automation,
web research, security, code analysis, and more.

Issue #281: Refactored from 716 lines of repetitive try/except blocks to
data-driven configuration pattern for improved maintainability.
