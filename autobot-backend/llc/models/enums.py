"""LLC module enum SSOT (GH#8261).

All LLC enums are defined here and imported everywhere — never redefined in
service or API files. This prevents the 23+ *Status enum duplication pattern
found in GH#7265 and GH#7504.

LLCAgentStatus decision: define a separate LLC-scoped enum (not extending the
canonical AgentStatus) because LLC agents have lifecycle states specific to
sprint/work-item assignment that don't map cleanly to the system-level
AgentStatus values. Cross-reference: GH#7504.
